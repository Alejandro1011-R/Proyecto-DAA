    "initial_solution: Your starting point (e.g., a list of movie scene indices).\n",
    "\n",
    "fitness_function: You need to define this function. It calculates the \"cost\" or \"fitness\" of a given solution. This is problem-specific. In the text, it's the \"total cost of film shooting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "generate_neighborhood: You need to define this function. It creates a list of neighboring solutions from a given solution using 2-opt and 2-swap moves. The example provided is a basic 2-swap, you need to implement the described domain structure.\n",

    "Example Usage (if __name__ == '__main__':)\n",
